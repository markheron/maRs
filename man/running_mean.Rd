\usage{
running_mean(vec, smooth, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{vec}{(numeric) vector to smooth}

  \item{smooth}{(int) the smothing window size}

  \item{...}{parameters to forward to mean}
}
\value{
smoothed vector
}
\description{
Computes the running mean of a vector.
}
\details{
The vector \code{vec} is smoothed by computing the mean for
a centered running window of the size \code{smooth}. The
first and last positions are repeats of the outermost
positiones for which the window still fit. If \code{smooth}
is an even number, the window is extended further to the
end.
