\title{running mean on matrix}
\usage{
running_mean_matrix(mat, smooth, over = "rows")
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{(numeric) matrix to smooth}

\item{smooth}{(int) the smothing window size}

\item{over}{(character) if the matrix should be smoothed over (i.e. along) the rows (first dimension) or columns (second dimension)}
}
\value{
smoothed matrix
}
\description{
Computes the running mean over one dimension of a matrix.
}
\details{
The matrix \code{mat} is smoothed by computing the mean for a centered running window of the size \code{smooth} along each row or column.
The first and last positions are smoothed over smaller running windows (i.e. cut off at the beginnig/end of the \code{mat}).
If \code{smooth} is an even number, the window is extended further to the end.
